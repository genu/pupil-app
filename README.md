# Pupil
## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a mobile tool for connecting students to each other for one on one homework help. The target audience for the platform is explicitly limited to university students and and to specific college campus where this platform is adapted. There are two fold benefits in this kind of peer-to-peer tutoring platform. First, it provides a resource for students that need homework help for a fee and, secondly, it enables students who have the advantage of having progressed further in their studies profit through this platform.
A key aspect to this project compared to other existing tools, is that an emphasis is placed on local university campus. The peers are encouraged to help, generally, students that they know, and/or, students that are part of the same student body as themselves. By doing this, a more comfortable tutoring experience is achieved.
